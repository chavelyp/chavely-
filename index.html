  <h2>Characterization</h2>
    <p>The main purpose of this archive is to be used as a resource by the Pittsburgh Academy of Medicine, which is an organization that is mainly made up of healthcare professionals and the department of medical education. It can be used as a resourceful component because the archive contains records of medical meetings, publications, research, scientific papers on new treatments and/ or diseases, and even copies of medical individual studies that may have been recorded. These records that make up the archive actually came from the academy itself and its members. They have been working throughout many years to develop so much data in efforts of assisting the creation of the archive. The collection functions properly because it provides the public, researchers, historians, and students in the medical field with access to very important information about the Academy’s impact and knowledge in the medical field. Since the  Pittsburgh Academy of Medicine Records collection contains records of personal studies, it overlaps with any researcher interested in whatever specific category that those records fall under. Another relationship between this collection and other archives is that the data in this specific archive can be used to monitor   trends on a national level and for the betterment of the medical field (SCP Health).  Further  expanding on that, this collection and ones that are similar can be crucial to the students and researchers and may even help them come up with new cures and knowledge regarding medical concerns that these records within the archive may have touched upon.

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Utilizing the archive</h2>
    <p> Given the extensive historical background from the Pittsburgh Academy of Medical Records archive, society faces a critical moment where we must interact with this data to improve our knowledge of medical procedures, patient treatment, and the development of healthcare regulations. Taking this into consideration, our main focus should be on digitizing the archive to ensure it is easily accessible to researchers, educators, medical professionals, and the general public. This would lead to the progression  of knowledge and allow  a wider range of people to interact with the materials, promoting functional partnerships among historians, medical professionals, and social scientists. By utilizing this collection as a basis, we are able to question current stories regarding the development of healthcare systems, such as the factors in society that influence health and the ingrained bias that have influenced medical documentation and patient interactions throughout history. In addition, the archive brings up important concerns regarding the ethical consequences of historical medical record-keeping methods, including privacy, consent, and how many populations are depicted in medical records. As we further dive into these different paths of examination, we might ask ourselves  how past information could impact present discussions on healthcare access and fairness, and how past medical procedures influence current health strategies. Additionally, it is important to think about how advancements in data management technology could change the future of medical record-keeping, which may  lead to  better patient and personalized care. In the end, utilizing the Pittsburgh Academy of Medical Records archive could enhance our historical knowledge and influence the future direction of healthcare practices by making them more accommodating, considerate, and adaptable to diverse communities.</p>
